# ISWT Encrypter and Decrypter
A simple tool with multiple functions relating to encryption and decryption.

Instructions provided within the program should be fairly self-explanatory for proceeding either with encryption and decryption. 

The random key generator generates keys by matching every character in the ASCII table with a random other character. A sample key file (generated with the random key generator) can be found among the files in the GitHub repository. Taking the format there as a basis, you can prepare your own key file and use it to encrypt or decrypt messages as you please.

I am aware that the program currently has relatively limited functionality. I intend to change that in the upcoming versions. The upcoming changes will include but not be limited to:
1) Adding a "mistake level" feature so that users do not have to go back to the very start when they enter an invalid option number
2) Adding a feature that allows users to create their own, personalised key files within the program
3) Making common encryption/decryption methods available
4) Making the random key generator more random and complex (e.g. by coming up with a different algorithm for odd and even indices, using multiple keys at the same time and so on)
